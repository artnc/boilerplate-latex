Boilerplate LaTeX
=================

I'm a fairly heavy LaTeX user, having done all of my college homework in LaTeX. Here's the template I use for new assignments. It's derived as a combination of all preamble statements I've ever used.

Note that there are some package clashes: Garamond with amsfonts, hyperref with TikZ, possibly others. I've commented them out in the provided source, so it should compile out of the box.

If you're using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2), you might find this [LaTeX build system](http://chaidarun.com/notes/sublime-build) helpful.

P.S. *Please* customize the listings package's settings before using it. Multiple students' assignments looking the same might arouse undue suspicion.
