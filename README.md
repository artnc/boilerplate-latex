Boilerplate LaTeX
=================

I'm a fairly heavy LaTeX user, having done all of my college homework assignments in LaTeX. Here's the template I use for new assignments. It's derived as a combination of all preamble statements I've ever used.

Note that there are some package clashes: Garamond with amsfonts, hyperref with TikZ, possibly others. I've commented them out in the provided source, so it should compile out of the box.

If you're using [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com/2) (which you should be using!), [here's a build system](http://chaidarun.com/notes/sublime-build) for LaTeX.
